"""Restart-idempotence regression for overlay/patch_scheduler_decode_floor.py.

The container entrypoint re-runs every overlay installer on each start.
patch_adaptive_k.py shares the decode-floor installer's helper anchor
(`from vllm.compilation.cuda_graph import CUDAGraphStat`), so on a restarted
container the adaptive-k block can sit either before or after the
decode-floor helper. The old verify path unpatched and re-applied the helper
at that fixed anchor, which relocated it and failed the byte-compare with
"v5 helper drifted" — a healthy, correctly patched file was rejected and the
entrypoint exited 1.

These tests build a synthetic scheduler from the installer's own *_OLD
anchors, so they run on any CPU without the vLLM image. They cover:

* apply on a clean tree, then verify (restart) — bytes preserved;
* a subsequent overlay inserting its helper before ours (image order);
* a subsequent overlay inserting its helper after ours (restart order);
* fail-closed rejection of helper-body drift, insertion drift, a missing
  helper, a duplicated helper, and a marker-only file.
